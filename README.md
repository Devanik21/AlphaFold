## 🎯 About This Project

This project represents a professional attempt to replicate the core functionality and user experience of DeepMind's revolutionary **AlphaFold** protein structure prediction system. While the original AlphaFold uses cutting-edge deep neural networks trained on evolutionary, physical, and chemical constraints, this implementation leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide sophisticated structural analysis and predictions.

### Key Inspiration: DeepMind's AlphaFold

DeepMind's AlphaFold has fundamentally transformed structural biology by solving the 50-year-old protein folding problem. Their system:
- Predicts 3D protein structures from amino acid sequences with atomic accuracy
- Uses attention mechanisms and geometric deep learning
- Achieved unprecedented accuracy (GDT-TS scores >90 for many targets)
- Has made structure predictions for 200M+ proteins available via the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database

**@deepmind** - This implementation aims to capture the essence of your groundbreaking work while exploring how modern LLMs can contribute to structural biology.
